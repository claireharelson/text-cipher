Module info: Module 7: Frequency Analysis

Approach: I first opened both files for reading and used the 'readlines' function to open them. I initialized some
variables and defined my function. I then used the 'strip' and 'split' functions to organize the frequency data in a
way that would allow me to manipulate it better. Next, I turned these values into a dictionary and sorted it by
ascending order of the values. I created a second dictionary with all letters of the alphabet and used a for loop
to iterate through the encrypted message while tallying up the number of times a letter appeared, then removed any
letters that had a count of zero. I also organized this dictionary in ascending order of values. I then turned my two
dictionaries into lists in their corresponding ascending order. I created a third dictionary and used it to map the
letters from these two lists to one another. Finally, I used iteration once again to replace the encrypted letters in
the message with the corresponding decrypted letters. I then decoded the final few letters by hand based on the
frequency data.

Known Bugs: No known bugs.
